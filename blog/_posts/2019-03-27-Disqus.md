I am pleased to announce that I finally have Disqus enabled on my site. Disqus is services that allow people to make comments on my posts. This post and all previous should now have a comment section at the bottom of each post. I was working on getting Disqus working but was running into issues the CSP policy.  

I finally figured it out and while the policy is not the best, it is something that I plan to work on to make it more secure.
