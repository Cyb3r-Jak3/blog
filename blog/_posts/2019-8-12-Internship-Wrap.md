Over the summer, I had the joy of working at Cisco Meraki for a 10-week internship as a network support engineer. This was a great opportunity to learn and I took full advantage of it. Over these ten weeks, I got a lot of hands-on experience with different network topologies from customers. I got to exposure to VOIP, QoS, DSCP, BGP, RSTP. I got to learn more about VLANs, LLDP, as well as various components and technologies that are involved in creating a wireless topology.  
While I was there I was able to meet some really smart people and we had some great discussions on different parts of networking and how to use them effectively. Meeting people there was definitely a great time both other interns and people who have a lot of experience in the field.  

I very much enjoyed my time there and would recommend it to anyone who wants to go into networking or even learn more about networking. You get to meet great people and learn a lot.
