I recently deployed a new [status website](https://status.jwhite.network). I had previously been using Uptime Robot for monitoring and alerting but I found [Upptime](https://github.com/upptime/upptime) which is a fully open-source solution that uses Github Actions, Issues, and Pages. It is super easy to get started with and configure. It took me about 20 minutes of reading documentation and making changes to have a full site up and running. For anyone who wants a quick and easy to deploy status site then I highly recommend Upptime.
