As I have talked about before I am a strong supporter of tor. I have a version of both my blog and my website that are hosted as a hidden service. I am proud to announce that I have increased my participation in tor with the hosting of an exit relay. My relay is new so it is not getting used as much, but there has been a good amount of usage so far.
