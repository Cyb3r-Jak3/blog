With Tor 0.3.2.9 released on January 9, 2019. This brought a new version of onion (v3) service feature. As can be viewed [here](https://blog.torproject.org/tor-0329-released-we-have-new-stable-series).  
Currently, my onion version of my website (http://jwhitenet4xmtr36.onion/) runs on version 2. I choose to only run it on version 2 because I did not have the technical knowledge and resources to create a customized version 3 address, while I was able to create a customized v2 address. However, after reading more about how to create a customized v3 address, I started to do so. At the time of this writing (February 02, 2019), I have started to generate an address that starts with jwhitenet. Unfortunately, it should take about 9 years to generate an address on a raspberry pi according to this [post](https://www.jamieweb.net/blog/onionv3-vanity-address/#generation-times). I am running on more powerful hardware but it will still need to take a lot of time to create an address.  I might cut down the prefix I want to just jwhite if it takes too long. In the meantime, I have an address generated of hkc6huta4wggdbueoiuny5xottt4pk553ofeglv4xgr3cqaovjnehdyd.onion, so you can visit my website there. I have also generated a version 3 address for my blog. It is sesccvwdfxu7kdsvnx24yi2p7iu2vyvccnr5b35zpwtr7yomri2o34yd.onion and it will be updated every time that I update my clearnet blog.
