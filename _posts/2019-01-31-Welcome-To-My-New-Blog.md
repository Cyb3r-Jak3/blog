## Welcome to My New Blog
As you can see from the layout, I have switched my blog hosting. I previously had a WordPress site on 000webhost, but I did not like it. It was slow and sometimes the connections would time while I was trying to make changes. WordPress is a great and easy solution for a blog but it did not offer markdown support for posts, which is something that I wanted in case I wanted to add code examples.  
My new solution is using Jekyll both with Github Pages at pages.jwhite.network as well as a self-hosted version at blog.jwhite.network. The pages ones will most likely be updated first as it is easier to update, but I will look into a CI solution that allows me to make updates quicker for both sites.  I also have an atom feed for my blog available at both pages.jwhite.network/feed.xml and blog.jwhite.network/feed.xml.  
There was a learning process with how Jekyll operates as well customizing a theme to my liking but I am happy with the end result. One thing that I do not like currently is the lack of security with my new blog. SSL works and fine but creating CSP policy that both works well without breaking my site is a work in progress.  I look forward to continuing to work on my site to make it more secure and blogging about cool cyber-related things.
