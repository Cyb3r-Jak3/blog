I am a very laid back person and want to keep a converstion or discussion going. That being said I will moderate comments if they get out of control. I really have one rule.

## Keep it civil aka don’t be a jerk

We’re going to get into the thick of a lot of heated discussions and that’s okay. These discussions often entail topics that we all personally care a lot about and will passionately defend. But in order for discussions to thrive here, we need to remember to criticize ideas, not people.
 
 So, remember to avoid:

  - name-calling
  - ad hominem attacks
  -  Responding to a post’s tone instead of its actual content.  
   - Calling out any bias you think is there is fine.
  -  knee-jerk contradiction

Comments that I find to be hateful, inflammatory, or harassing may be removed. If you don’t have something nice to say about another user, don't say it. Treat others the way you’d like to be treated. Other small things

## Stay On-topic

Be sure your topic matches the general theme of the channel. For example, all discussions on Talk Shop should pertain to fashion and beauty. Not sure if you’re posting to the right channel? Check the channel’s About section, or recently-added discussions to get an idea of what subjects are appropriate.

## No (Irreverent) Self-promotion

A discussion or comment that contains only a link to your blog, a product, or your article on another site will almost always be removed if they are not about the current discussion going on.

## Choose Your (Curse) Words Wisely

Comments that contain profanity are automatically held for moderator review before being posted. Depending on the context of the comment, it may be removed. Profanity used to insult, antagonize, or inflame will always be removed.

## Don’t Copy and Paste

If you didn’t write it, or haven’t properly cited the article you’re quoting, don’t post it. Like this policy. I did not write it, I copied and made edits from Disqus's suggested one found [here](https://help.disqus.com/community-tips/building-identity-and-audience/sample-community-guidelines).  


### Final Note
I believe in transparency. I will post all comments that I remove to a banned comments page along with why I removed them. I may or may not censor the comments if they are extremely offensive but I will mark them as such.
